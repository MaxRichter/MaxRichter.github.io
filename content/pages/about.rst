Hi, I am Max a Software Engineering Manager with interest in Software Architecture, code as craftsmannship
and working in a Dev-Ops oriented environment.

POC's for latest technologies as well my view on topics as an engineering manager.

Well, let's get to work! I am looking forward to your feedback via comments or maxrichter@acm.org.
