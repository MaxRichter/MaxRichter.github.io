What is ACM?
------------

`ACM <https://www.acm.org/>`_, the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession.
ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources.

Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
---------------------------------------

A very important part of signing up, is to agree to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
In times like now, it is more than ever necessary to demonstrate equality and respect for all individuals.

As an outline, you find the summary of the 4 sections:

.. code-block:: bash

    - Section 1 outlines fundamental ethical principles that form the basis for the remainder of the Code.
    - Section 2 addresses additional, more specific considerations of professional responsibility.
    - Section 3 guides individuals who have a leadership role, whether in the workplace or in a volunteer professional capacity.
    - Commitment to ethical conduct is required of every ACM member, and principles involving compliance with the Code are given in Section 4.

You find the full Code of Ethics `here <https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics>`_.

Benefits of joining
-------------------

I asked myself the questions "Why should I join?"
ACM itself lists the numerous `benefits <https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-benefits>`_ available.

For myself, the top 3 highlights are:

1. The network: According to ACM, nearly 100,000 highly dedicated student and professional peers are available for professional exchange including 37 Special Interest Groups (SIGs).
2. Learning Center with resources for lifelong learning:

    - Including online courses targeted toward essential IT skills and popular certifications like AWS or Azure
    - Online books & videos from `Skillsoft® <https://acm.skillport.com/skillportfe/custom/login/saml/login.action>`_, online books from `O'Reilly® <https://go.oreilly.com/acm>`_, `ScienceDirect <https://auth.elsevier.com/ShibAuth/institutionLogin?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.acm.org%2Fidp%2Fshibboleth&appReturnURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com>`_, Morgan Kaufmann and Syngress
    - Videos and webinars on hot topics, presented by today's innovators
3. Access to the full `ACM Digital Library <https://dl.acm.org/>`_, which includes over 2 million pages of text

Different `Membership Options <https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options>`_ exist for Professionals ($99 per year), Students
as well as Special Member rates.

If you for example just look at the access to the O'Reilly online learning platform, you save $400 per year in comparison to purchase it `directly <https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/pricing.html>`_.

Summary
-------

ACM offers great resources for life-ling learning at a very affordable price in the ever changing world of computer science.
To highlight it one more time, is the agreement to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
